# HW2

## Description
This repository contains Homework 2 for the Web course.  
The project demonstrates the same page layout implemented in different ways, according to the assignment instructions.

## Implementations
The repository includes **four versions** of the same layout:

1. **CSS Plain** – implemented using classic CSS (no Flex, no Grid, no Bootstrap).  
   File: `plain.html`

2. **CSS Plain generated with GitHub Copilot**.  
   File: `web-2-b.html`

3. **Flexbox generated with GitHub Copilot**, using the same class names as the CSS Plain version.  
   File: `flex.html`

4. **Bootstrap layout generated with GitHub Copilot**.  
   File: `bootstrap.html`

## GitHub Pages

## Notes

- Media queries are used to make the layout responsive (stacked layout below 750px).
- GitHub Copilot was used for the Copilot-based implementations.
